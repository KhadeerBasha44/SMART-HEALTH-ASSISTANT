Machine Learning-based system to predict Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's.


### ðŸ“˜ **Project Title**: *Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning*

This thesis project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases â€” namely **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson's Disease** â€” based on user-input medical parameters. The aim is to assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment using data-driven models.

The system leverages supervised learning algorithms such as **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Logistic Regression** to achieve accurate predictions. A user-friendly interface was built using **Streamlit** and **Tkinter**, making the tool easily accessible to both medical professionals and general users.

ðŸ§  **Technologies Used**:
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Streamlit & Tkinter (for GUI)
- Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

ðŸŽ¯ **Project Goals**:
- Build reliable ML models for three different diseases
- Evaluate and compare model performance (Accuracy, AUC)
- Provide a unified prediction interface
- Encourage early diagnosis and data-driven decision-making
